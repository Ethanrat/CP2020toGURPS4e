# CP2020toGURPS4e
This is a conversion of R. Talsorian Games' Cyberpunk 2020 to GURPS 4e. Requires GCS to work.

What to expect?

A couple of rules are introduced, for example GURPS never had Cyberpsychosis, now it will.
Other than that it's mostly a bunch of items you can use for your Cyberpunk games.

For the databases, notes, conversion rules etc. you will need a copy of GCS:

To install the database on Windows (and quite likely on Linux too) you will have to clone this repository and put the whole thing in the \~path\GCS\Library folder.
Make a separate folder for it in the Library folder, preferably.
I don't know how it works under Mac, sorry.
