# CP2020toGURPS4e
This is a conversion of Cyberpunk 2020 to GURPS 4e. Requires GCS to work.

For the databases, notes, conversion rules etc. you will need a copy of GCS:
http://gurpscharactersheet.com/

To install the database on Windows (and quite likely on Linux too) you will have to clone this repository and put the whole thing in the /~path/GCS/Library folder.
Make a separate folder for it in the Library folder, preferably.
I don't know how it works under Mac, sorry.
